WiMedKG is a medical knowledge graph constructed via automated methods. In building the knowledge graph, we adhered to guidelines proposed under the supervision of medical professionals. Our novel knowledge graph construction process, which includes stages for knowledge extraction and validation, has enabled the fine-grained extraction and quality enhancement of medical knowledge from multiple sources. The final knowledge graph encompasses detailed medical knowledge across various types and sources, covering 111 departments and meticulously categorized into 29 entity types, 128 relationship types, and 40 attribute types, comprising a total of 367,108 entities, 3,176,389 relationship triples, and 1,021,966 attribute triples. It has been evaluated by medical professionals with a score of 90.66%.

Based on WiMedKG, we have developed WiMedLLM, a large language model enhanced with medical knowledge retrieval capabilities. Experimental results have validated the effectiveness of knowledge enhancement and the necessity of our construction guidelines.

The knowledge graph retrieval platform can be accessed at: [http://43.140.200.9:7474](http://59.110.228.72:10007/main). We are willing to provide the knowledge graph data and manual evaluation records if needed.
